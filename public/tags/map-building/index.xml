      <description>In this project, the objective is to conduct an analysis of Scottish schools in order to derive valuable insights. In a separate article, a clustering and descriptive analysis of schools based on their deprivation rate and total number of pupils was performed. The resulting model categorized local authorities into three distinct clusters based on their average pupil count and deprivation score. The present article showcases an interactive map that visually illustrates the areas predominantly occupied by schools facing high levels of deprivation. The intention behind this is to provide guidance to charities or non-governmental organizations engaged in projects aimed at assisting school pupils. All data utilized in this analysis is publicly available and sourced from the website of the Scottish Government. Furthermore, the Postcodes.io API was employed to gather the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each school based on their respective postcodes. The code for constructing the map, as well as an API application for retrieving external information, along with the datasets employed, can be found in the projectâ€™s GitHub repository. All materials within the repository are free to be utilized for personal and commercial purposes without requiring my consent.</description>
